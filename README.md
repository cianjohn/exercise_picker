starting with a pushup tracker,

i intend to continue updating until i have a full gym exercise planner and rep,weight,set, tracker with dates and graphs, and a full list of exercises to pick from

possibly also recomendations of my knowledge of body building for sets and rep ranges per week and how the plan matches those

(10-20 working sets per week per muscle group)
working set = one sufficentlu close to failure (1-3 reps remaining)
(accounting for over fatigueing assesory muscles in extraneous exercises)
(rep ranges: 3-5 = strength, 8-12 = hyperthrophy 15+ = endurance)
^^ only count if the weight used make those would make those rep ranges count as working sets
